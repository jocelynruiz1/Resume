        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, my name is Jocelyn Ruiz, I am an undergraduate student at the University of Riverside planning to go into the Urban Planning field in order to help better communities. I am an outspoken, confident person that is eager to learn new skill sets. I have a significant amount of experience within Environmental Science, networking, and leadership. I was a part of the Green Technology Academy for 4 years where I learned multiple skills such as: working with 3D design software; processes of design; engineering processes; energy efficiency; blueprint creation and reading; sustainable building; and energy auditing. I participated in many activities that helped broaden my horizons when it comes to understanding Green Technology such as: Business luncheons, presentations, lab assignments, volunteer opportunities, projects, attending career fairs, organizing science events, and visiting colleges and companies.  Furthermore, I helped the academy recruit new students by creating and performing an informational presentation which gave me an opportunity to network with people in my community and gain awareness for the academy. I have also developed great communication skills throughout my years with the academy and have presented in front of my peers and school officials multiple times. I have done extensive research on renewable and alternative energy sources and have also presented to my community about issues with our energy use. I also had the honor of being vice president of our Green Club where I set up volunteer opportunities, fundraisers, and community outreach programs. This academy provided me with first-hand experience that I am excited to bring to your company.<br><br>

        Further, I also have experience with leading a team because I was captain of dance. Here, I learned ways to manage team of diverse individuals with efficiency and patience. I know that I work well under pressure and can lead a team through times of adversity because of my experience of being a captain. I am a goal driven person that can think outside of the box in any given situation. Moreover, I have good discipline and respect the people in authority which is also a good skill to have. 
	In addition, I have experience with childcare. I have been a daycareâ€™s assistant for more than 5 years. I am CPR and First Aid certified. I also have training in suicide and abuse awareness. These trainings and certifications can come in handy when working with a team of people because mental and physical health are key elements in job efficiency. When your team feels good jobs will be performed accurately and help the company reach higher standards. 
<br><br>

        Additionally, I am a native Spanish speaker and have received the Seal of Biliteracy. I am certified to translate Spanish to English or the other way around, which I have actually done numerous times. This skill allows me to reach a whole new group of people and be able to accurately communicate with them or offer them my help when it is needed. I can also connect the company to greater horizons outside of the English-speaking world by marketing and networking in Spanish. 
To conclude, I am certain that I will be a great asset to your company and will help improve many aspects of it.
